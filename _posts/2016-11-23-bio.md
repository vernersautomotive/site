Verner McCall opened his garage in 1986 with the intention of providing excellent service at a reasonable price. He did it by attracting dedicated employees and buying his facilities and equipment outright instead of leasing. After 30+ years he's still passionate about doing great work for his loyal customers.

He also loves mountain biking.
