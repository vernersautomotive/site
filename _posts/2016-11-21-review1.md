Verner's is amazing. A couple weeks ago my '05 Audi A4 check engine light came on. I initially took it to the dealership and called a few other shops, but all said it would be upwards of 2 weeks until they could look at my car. I called Verner's and they offered to look at my engine that same day and ended up fixing the issue overnight, even though they were booked.
