For me, the media object is more than just a layout construct; for me, the media object is the poster-child of everything OOCSS stands for. The media object is so glaringly simple that, when I first read about it, I laughed out loud. The idea of taking such a common design pattern and distilling it into a tiny, robust, reusable abstraction was so clever yet so simple that I fell in love straight away. It also made me realise that, for too long, CSS had been left to people with a designer’s mind; any code needs the mind of a developer applied to it, someone who gets DRYness, abstraction, efficiency, etc.

The media object’s job is simply to display an image with some text content beside it, both aligned to the tops of each other, with a little gap between. It also has the option have the image on either the left- or right-hand side of the text. This is the SRP to a tee.

wtf?
