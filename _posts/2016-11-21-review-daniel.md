I've owned nearly 20 VWs and I've done a ton of wrenching myself (I've rebuilt aircooled engines, done tons of different repairs on both aircooled and watercooled). I can attest this shop is legit. It's clear that they really KNOW VWs and are committed to providing quality service. If you have a VW in CO you'd be a fool to not let them work on yours.
