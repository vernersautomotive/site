Verner Rocks! My son and I had VW Eurovan issues while vacationing in Rocky Mountain National Park from Oregon. Verner instantly got us in and diagnosed the problem. This was a problem that a mechanic in Oregon had misdiagnosed and failed to fix properly prior to our trip. Verner had us back on our vacation within 6 hours!
