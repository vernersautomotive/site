Verner’s team of mechanics share a commitment to the local community and a passion for Audi and Volkswagen cars. They're all people who weren’t interested in joining the corporate work environment that pervades most dealerships and automotive service chains. Everyone in the team has chosen the life of an auto mechanic because of their passion for cars and their desire to work in a independent business that really benefits their friends, family, and the people in their area.
