Verner’s team of ASE certified mechanics share a commitment to the local community and a passion for Audi and Volkswagen cars. Most of our team has been with us for more than a decade. They're all people who weren’t interested in joining the corporate work environment that pervades most dealerships and automotive service chains. Everyone here has chosen the life of an auto mechanic because of their passion for cars and their desire to work in a independent business that really benefits their friends, family, and fellow human beings.
